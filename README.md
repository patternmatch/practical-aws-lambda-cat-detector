## Motivation

![UI sample](cat-detector-ui.png)

Cats are cute, but *sneaky* animals. They can hide in almost any corner, and remain undetected for hours. Let's leverage *AWS* and *Serverless* approach to built together a **CatDetector** - an app that will help us finding our favorite pupils in an infinite stream of images!

Repository is a foundation for an interactive workshops. To get more info about workshops - why we do it and how we do it, read the following blog post: https://pattern-match.com/blog/2019/06/21/serverless-cat-detector-natywna-chmura-15-06-2019/

We have performed it on following conferences:

During that we covered following topics:

- *AWS Lambda*,
- *AWS X-Ray*,
- *AWS S3*,
