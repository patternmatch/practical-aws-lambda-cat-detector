# serverless-cat-detector

## Motivation

Cats are cute, but *sneaky* animals. They can hide in almost any corner, and remain undetected for hours. Let's leverage *AWS* and *Serverless* approach to built together a **CatDetector** - an app that will help us finding our favorite pupils in an infinite stream of images!

Repository is a foundation for an interactive workshops. We have perfomed it on following conferences:

- [Cloudyna 2017](https://cloudyna.net) (*Katowice*, *Poland*).

During that we will cover following topics:

- *AWS Lambda*,
- *AWS X-Ray*,
- *AWS S3*,
- *AWS DynamoDB*,
- *AWS Rekognition*,
- [*Serverless Framework*](https://serverless.com),
- *Best practices*, when it comes to development of such applications.
